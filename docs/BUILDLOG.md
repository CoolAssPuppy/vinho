# Vinho Build Log

## Project Kickoff - November 1 Target

### 2025-09-20: Repository Setup and Documentation Foundation

**What changed:**

- Initialized build log to track all development progress
- Starting Phase 0: Documentation and architecture planning
- Targeting November 1 production launch

**How to run locally:**

```bash
# Clone and setup
cd ~/Developer/vinho
pnpm install

# Verify Supabase connection
supabase link --project-ref aghiopwrzzvamssgcwpv
```

**Tests added:**

**Risks:**

- Tight timeline to November 1
- Need to balance speed with production quality
- Supabase cloud dependency for development

**Next steps:**
